# 🏛️ Citizen Portal & Service Request System

## 📌 Introduction
The **Citizen Portal & Service Request System** is a digital platform designed to enhance civic engagement by enabling residents to actively participate in the governance of our municipality.  
It empowers citizens to **vote on proposals**, **submit new discussion topics**, **provide feedback**, and **update their personal profiles**, all while maintaining **user anonymity**.

The portal verifies each user’s identity to ensure they are registered city residents but keeps them anonymous to each other, fostering a **safe and open environment** for civic participation.
